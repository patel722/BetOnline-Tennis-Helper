Hello,

This Chrome extension serves to quickly showcase Total Number of Games in a Set for a live tennis match on BetOnline. Additionally, it shows the Total Number of Games in a match. 

Simple calculator, nothing to extensive. Works on Tennis live matches only on BetOnline, may show results for other types of matches but it may not be accurate.
Don't pin to toolbar as this will give it permission for every site you vist and that causes slowness. It's defined to only work on betonline.ag domain however, I recommened to pin/unpin as needed.
